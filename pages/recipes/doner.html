    <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Doner kebab is a type of kebab, made of meat cooked on a vertical rotisserie. Seasoned meat stacked in the shape of an inverted cone is turned<br> slowly on the rotisserie, next to a vertical cooking element. The operator uses a knife to slice thin shavings from the outer layer of the meat as it cooks.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <h5>For the Kebab:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground lamb (or 1/2 pound each of ground lamb and ground beef)</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>4 clove garlic, peeled and finely minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon oil, more for the pan</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>For the Sandwich:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large pita, naan, or flatbread</li>
        <li>1 cup assorted lettuce leaves</li>
        <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
        <li>1/2 medium English cucumber, sliced</li>
        <li>1/4 large red onion, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>Tzatziki sauce or tahini sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 F.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the ground lamb, egg, garlic, ground cumin, ground coriander, smoked paprika, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Place the mixture into an oiled 9 x 5-inch loaf pan and cook in the oven for approximately 30 minutes or until the top is a light golden brown.</li>
        <li>You can slice the loaf immediately if you like but, for best results, cool completely, wrap in aluminum foil, and refrigerate until firm.</li>
        <li>To reheat, add a little olive oil to a large skillet, slice the loaf very thinly and crisp up the slices in the hot pan for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Assemble the sandwiches with pita, warmed and toasted through. Spread on some tzatziki or tahini sauce, add lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, and top with more sauce.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
